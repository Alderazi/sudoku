    <h1>How to Play Sudoku</h1>
    <p>Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle game. Your goal is to fill the 9×9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the 3×3 boxes contains all the numbers from <strong>1 to 9</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each row must have the numbers 1 to 9 with no repetition.</li>
      <li>Each column must have the numbers 1 to 9 with no repetition.</li>
      <li>Each 3×3 box must have the numbers 1 to 9 with no repetition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Click a cell to select it.</li>
      <li>Choose a number from the number pad below (or type it with your keyboard).</li>
      <li>If it's correct, it stays. If it's wrong, you may get a mistake.</li>
      <li>You lose if you make 3 mistakes (or whatever your game's rule is).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with boxes, rows, or columns that have the most numbers already filled in.</li>
      <li>Use logic—not guessing—to figure out where numbers go.</li>
      <li>Use note mode if you're unsure about a number. It helps track possibilities.</li>
    </ul>
